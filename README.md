# Tweeter Project

Welcome to the Tweeter Project, a simple and delightful single-page Twitter clone!

## Project Description
Tweeter was created as part of the Lighthouse Bootcamp by Sofia Oliveira. Its main purpose is to showcase my front-end development skills and demonstrate my proficiency in web technologies.

## Technologies Used
For this project, I leveraged a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX to build a basic yet engaging 'Twitter'-like interface. These technologies allowed me to craft a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Embracing Responsive Front-end Development
One of the core aspects of this project was honing my skills in responsive front-end development. I made sure that the Tweeter interface adapts beautifully to various devices and screen sizes. Whether users access the application on their desktop or mobile devices, they can enjoy a consistent and visually appealing experience.
